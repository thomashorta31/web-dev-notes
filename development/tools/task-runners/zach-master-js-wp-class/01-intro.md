# Task Runners
Manage and run command line operations and tools

# Build Systems
Task runners with the extra ability to compile using imports and exports in your code.

## Common Tasks
Generally involve other tools

* Watch files for changes
* Combine files
* Minify files
* Check for errors
* Run tests
* Refresh browser on changes
* Run local web servers

## Task Runners and Build Systems
In the order they came to market

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
2. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
3. [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

* Can be slightly different things but overlap in certain areas

## What we will do
* Setup Configuration file
* Watch files for changes
* Combine & minify files
* Run a local server
* Live reload browser
* Integrate with other tools
* Create custom commands

## Which One is Best?
Just be ready for whichever one you come across.

## Goals
1. Get comfortable with each
2. Be able to do roughly the same thing with each
3. Understand difference between them
4. Later, use them each in different projects
