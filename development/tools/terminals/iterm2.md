# iTerm2

## Change keyboard shortcuts to move faster by words left and right
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81272/is-there-any-way-in-the-os-x-terminal-to-move-the-cursor-word-by-word/8250989#8250989)
I used the above tutorial to make `cmd` + `left arrow` move left one word and `cmd` + `right arrow` move right one word

`ctrl` + `a` - moves you to front of line
`ctrl` + `e` - moves you to end of line
`ctrl` + `u` - clears line (oh-my-zsh)
`take` - better than `mkdir folder-name` because it creates the folder and moves you into it (oh-my-zsh)

## iTerm is better

The terminal is cool but I really like iTerm (I think it's iTerm2 now).
